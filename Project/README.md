# Hate Speech Detection with Sentiment Analysis
 
 ## What is Sentiment Analysis?
 Sentiment Analysis refers to the use of Natural Language Processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Given a set of texts with an attached sentiment label, the goal of every sentiment analysis task is to predict the sentiment of a given text data.


 ## Problem Statement
 Our goal in this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. We can say a tweet contains hate speech or abusive language if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to separate racist or sexist tweets from other tweets. Given a training sample of tweets and labels, the label '0' denotes the tweet doesn't contain hate speech and the labels '1', '2' and '3' denote the tweet contain hate or abusive speech in different degrees, being 3 the highest. Our objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

  ## Motivation
  Unfortunately, hate speech is common on the Internet nowadays. Social media sites face the problem of identifying and censoring problematic posts while weighing the right to freedom of speech. Therefore, the importance of detecting and moderating hate speech is evident from the strong connection between hate speech and actual hate crimes. The early identification of users promoting hate speech could enable outreach programs that attempt to prevent an escalation from speech to action. These sites have been seeking to actively fight hate speech. Despite these reasons, NLP research on hate speech has been very limited, primarily due to the lack of a general definition of hate speech, an analysis of its demographic influences, and an investigation of the most effective features. Also the difficulty to come to an agreement when annotating hate speech (inter-annotator agreement).
  
  ## Data
  The dataset consists of a csv file with over 30000 samples of tweet data. We will process and split this unique file into three subsets: train, validation and test. Given the little amount of data in each remaining subset, we already predict that using a neural network for this task won't retrieve the desired results.
